# Smart Expense Tracker 💰

As a **Final Year CS Student**, I developed this project to demonstrate **File Handling** and **Data Persistence** in Python. This is the second project in my 90-day software engineering sprint.

## 🚀 Overview
Unlike basic programs that lose data when closed, this Expense Tracker saves every entry into a local file. It is a practical tool for managing daily budgets through a command-line interface.

## ✨ Features
- **Persistent Storage:** Data is saved in `expenses.txt`.
- **Automatic Calculation:** Sums up all expenses to show total spending.
- **Header Management:** Automatically initializes the data file with proper headers.
- **Error Handling:** Safe data reading even if the file is empty or missing.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Applied
- **File I/O:** Reading and writing to external files (`open`, `write`, `readlines`).
- **OS Module:** Checking file existence and path management.
- **Exception Handling:** Using `try-except` blocks to prevent crashes.

## 📖 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `python expense_tracker.py` in your terminal.
